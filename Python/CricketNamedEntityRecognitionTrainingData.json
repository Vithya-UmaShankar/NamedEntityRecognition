The target was a big one and the stakes were high but they have nailed some fantastic chases this season and this is another one of those. They lost Saha in the first over but Gill and Wade kept the momentum on their side as they found boundaries at regular intervals in the Powerplay. However, Gill got run out in the 8th over in an unfortunate manner and Wade followed soon. The best thing about this chase was the required rate never got out of the hands as Miller and Pandya planned it superbly. The second-last over though brought the equation to 16 off 6 but Miller, as cool as ever, finished the chase with three towering sixes.",
